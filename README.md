Torch is a Python implementation of NASA's tangent ogive nosecone aerodynamic heating program (NQLD019).

## Installation
`pip install git+https://github.com/cuspaceflight/torch.git`

## Examples

See the two Jupyter notebooks ('Example - Black Brant.ipynb' and 'Example - NASA TND 889.ipynb') for examples of how to run simulations, and how the results compare with original data generated by NASA.

There is also an additional example in the CUSF CamPyRoS repository, which uses variable wall temperatures and some of the built in plotting functions:
